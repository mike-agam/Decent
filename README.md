### What is Decent?
Decent is a chatroom application that utilizes the Nano cryptocurrency network to allow for communications without a central server.

### What can Decent be used for?
Decent is a functional proof of concept for an immutable, censorship-resistant messaging service. Because the entirety of Decent's transactions are sent and received through the decentralized Nano cryptocurrency network, restricting access to the service is far more difficult than blocking an IP address.

### How does Decent work?
A transaction using the Nano digital payment protocol allows for a unit of Nano currency to be divided into thirty decimal places. By assigning each commonly used character a numerical representation, we can use the numbers 00 through 99 in order to encode messages into each transaction. While each whole unit of Nano costs roughly $5 at any given point in time, by only utilizing the last sixteen digits of a thirty decimal transaction, we can create transactions that cost fractions of a cent that can be used to transmit messages.

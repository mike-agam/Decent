### What can Decent be used for?
Decent is a functional proof of concept for an immutable and censorship-resistant messaging service. Because the entirety of Decent's transactions are sent and received through the Nano cryptocurrency network, it is not reliant on a central server, which makes it difficult for bad actors to interfere with the service. As a result, the Decent chatroom protocol has the following advantages:

* Blocking access to a Decent chatroom requires significantly more effort than blocking a single IP address, and cannot be done without blocking the entirety of Nano's decentralized network.
* Like a blockchain, Nano's block lattice architecture ensures that upon being sent, messages are permanent and cannot be tampered with, modified, or removed.
* Nano's block lattice architecture also prevents your Decent chatroom from being removed from the network by any means.
* In the near future, Decent chatrooms will allow for encrypted communications between security-conscious individuals.

### What is Nano?
Nano is a cryptocurrency that utilizes a lightweight block lattice architecture in order to create feeless, fast, and enviornmentally friendly transactions between users. Because of its speed and feeless nature, it's ideal for hosting free and decentralized services like online chatrooms.

### How does Decent work?
A transaction using the Nano digital payment protocol allows for a unit of Nano currency to be divided into thirty decimal places. By assigning each commonly used character a numerical representation, we can use the numbers 00 through 99 in order to encode messages into each transaction. While each whole unit of Nano costs roughly $5 at any given point in time, by only utilizing the last sixteen digits of a thirty decimal transaction, we can create transactions that cost fractions of a cent that can be used to transmit messages.
